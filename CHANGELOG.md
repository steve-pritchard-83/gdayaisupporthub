## Project History

### [January 2025] - Light/Dark Theme Toggle Implementation - Claude Sonnet 4

### Added
- **Full theme toggle system** with light/dark mode switching
- **Theme context provider** with localStorage persistence
- **Theme-aware SVG logo** that adapts text color based on theme
- **Toggle button** in header navigation (sun/moon icons)
- **CSS theme variables** for both light and dark modes
- **Email capture** in ticket creation form for Teams contact
- **Admin-only ticket controls** - only authenticated admins can edit/delete tickets

### Changed
- **All CSS components** updated to use theme variables instead of hardcoded colors
- **Logo text color** now switches between white (dark theme) and dark grey (light theme)
- **Ticket interface** updated to include email field with validation
- **Admin dashboard** now displays user email addresses for Teams outreach
- **Navigation layout** updated to include theme toggle button
- **Status badges** now use `whitespace-nowrap` to prevent text wrapping

### Fixed
- **TypeScript errors** in admin analytics for category names
- **Status display** formatting issues in admin dashboard
- **Build configuration** already optimized for static export

### Decisions Made
- **Default theme**: Dark mode by default, stored in localStorage as 'gday-theme'
- **Logo adaptation**: SVG text uses CSS variable `--logo-text` for theme-aware coloring
- **Theme persistence**: User preference saved across browser sessions
- **Email requirement**: All new tickets must include user email for admin follow-up
- **Access control**: Only authenticated admins can modify or delete tickets
- **Design demo removal**: Removed from navigation to clean up menu

### Notes
- Theme system is fully functional and provides professional UX
- Email integration enables Teams-based user outreach
- All existing functionality preserved while adding new features
- Ready for production deployment with static export
